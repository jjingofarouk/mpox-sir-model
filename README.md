# Mpox SIR Model Simulation

This is a Flask web application that simulates the spread of **Mpox** (formerly Monkeypox) using the **SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model**. The app allows users to input parameters and visualize how the disease spreads over time.

üëâ **Live Demo**: [https://mpox-sir-model.onrender.com](https://mpox-sir-model.onrender.com)

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Parameter Inputs**: Adjust population, initial infected, infection rate, recovery rate, and simulation days.
- **Interactive Plot**: Visualize the spread of Mpox over time with a dynamic plot.
- **Summary Metrics**: View key metrics such as:
  - Peak infection day and number of infected individuals.
  - Total number of recovered individuals.
  - Final number of susceptible individuals.
- **Downloadable Report**: Export simulation results as a PDF.

---

## How to Use

1. **Access the App**:
   - Visit the live demo: [https://mpox-sir-model.onrender.com](https://mpox-sir-model.onrender.com).

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - Enter the following values:
     - **Total Population**: The total number of individuals in the population.
     - **Initial Infected**: The number of initially infected individuals.
     - **Infection Rate (Œ≤)**: The rate at which the disease spreads.
     - **Recovery Rate (Œ≥)**: The rate at which infected individuals recover.
     - **Simulation Days**: The number of days to simulate.

3. **Run Simulation**:
   - Click the **Run Simulation** button to generate the SIR model plot and summary.

4. **View Results**:
   - The plot shows the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals over time.
   - The summary provides key metrics about the simulation.

5. **Download Report**:
   - Click the **Download Report as PDF** button to save the simulation results.

## How It Works

The app uses the **SIR model**, a mathematical framework for simulating the spread of infectious diseases. The model divides the population into three compartments:

- **Susceptible (S)**: Individuals who are not infected but could become infected.
- **Infected (I)**: Individuals who are currently infected and can spread the disease.
- **Recovered (R)**: Individuals who have recovered from the infection and are immune.

The model is defined by the following differential equations:

\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta \cdot S \cdot I / N
\]
\[
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \cdot S \cdot I / N - \gamma \cdot I
\]
\[
\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma \cdot I
\]

Where:
- \( N \) is the total population.
- \( \beta \) is the infection rate.
- \( \gamma \) is the recovery rate.
